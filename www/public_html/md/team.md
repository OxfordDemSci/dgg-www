<img src="../img/staff/ridhi.jpg" alt="Photo of Ridhi" width="400">  

Ridhi is professor of demography and computational social science at the University of Oxford and professorial fellow 
of Nuffield College. She is the Principal Investigator of the Digital Gender Gaps project. Her research spans different 
areas of demography and sociology. As a part of the Digital Gender Gaps project, she along with her collaborators are 
studying gender inequalities in internet and mobile use and their implications for other types of social inequalities. 
Her other research is on topics such as son preference, prenatal sex selection and gender gaps in health and mortality, 
and the effects of educational expansion on marriage and family change. Her methodological interests focus on how 
computational innovations both in terms of modelling approaches and digital data from web and social media platforms 
can be applied to study social and demographic phenomena. She is especially interested in how big data can be used to 
measure and monitor sustainable development goals.
