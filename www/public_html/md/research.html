    The <strong> Digital Gender Gaps </strong> project seeks to deepen data
    and empirical evidence through two complementary streams of research:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Map and understand gender gaps in digital connectivity and social media use,
      leveraging a range of datasets including social media, geospatial and population survey
      and census datasets at national and subnational levels. The map and indicators shown on
      this web app are one of the outcomes of our ongoing research;
  </li>

  <li>Study the impacts of digital information and capabilities on women’s economic and social
      empowerment outcomes in a cross-national, comparative perspective, especially focusing
      low- and middle-income country contexts. To study these links between digital expansion
      and empowerment outcomes, we rely on geospatial augmentation of secondary survey datasets
      and quasi-experimental strategies to help generate an evidence base for understanding if,
      how and when digital technologies can help achieve wider social impacts.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The project is led by the Department of Sociology and Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science,
University of Oxford in collaboration with the Societal Computing Group at Saarland University,
and the Department of Business Economics, Health, and Social Care (DEASS) of University of Applied
Sciences and Arts of Southern Switzerland (SUPSI). For more information about ongoing research,
